                <p><b>The term <em>"perfume" </em> refers to a concoction of fragrant essential oils or aroma compounds (fragrances), fixatives, and solvents, typically in liquid form, used to impart a pleasant scent to objects, animals, and people. A chemical that emits and diffuses a pleasant and fragrant odor is what is known as a perfume.They are made up of synthetic blends of essential oils and aromatic compounds.The Latin verb "perfumare" (which means "to smoke through") is the source of the English term "perfume." The practice of perfumery, or the art of creating fragrances, dates back to prehistoric China, Egypt, and ancient Mesopotamia.The Muslims and Romans improved it further.
                    One has a lot of fantastic options when choosing a scent, including perfumes.</p>

                    <h3>Eau De Parfum</h3>
                    <p>A strong perfume with between 15% and 20% oil concentration is called eau de parfum. Compared to raw perfumes, which have an oil concentration of 20% to 30%, it has a higher scent concentration. You should expect your fragrance to last for a good four to five hours on average while still having very little alcohol to ensure skin tolerance.
                        Eau de parfum is typically a nice middle ground for those seeking a scent that is less potent than perfume but still lasts for at least six hours. These scents are perfect for a romantic evening or special occasion because they last longer, feel more intimate, and do so.

                    <h3>Eau De toilette</h3>
                    <p>
                        The ritual of getting ready for the day, including cleaning, performing regular cosmetic routines, and spritzing on your favorite fragrance, is known as "toilette" in French. Around 10% of the fragranced oils that produce the distinctive nuances of your chosen aroma are combined in eau de toilette. Typically, scents are delicate and new, fading over the course of many hours. They make wonderful summer and every day smells that are never overpowering. 
                        People who want to lightly perfume themselves, such in the evening, frequently love it. With an oil content of between 5% and 15%, it has a wonderful light aroma that lingers on the skin for 3 to 5 hours.

                    <h3>Eau De Cologne</h3>
                    <p>These fragrances are based on an ancient formula that mostly consisted of citrus and herb notes with minimal base notes for anchoring. As more of this light, fresh, and gentle fragrance has to be worn throughout the day, eau de cologne typically comes in larger quantities. Between 3% and 6% of cologne is made up of pure perfume. 
                        The eau de cologne is significantly less expensive than those mentioned above due to its higher alcohol content and lower aroma concentration (2% to 4%). Typically, it lasts up to two hours.</p>

                    <p>This last fragrance is quite similar to the previous one, in that the scent will last for up to two hours. However, it has an even lower fragrance concentration of only 1% to 3%.
                        The main difference is that eau fraiche does not contain a high amount of alcohol. Eau fraiche is mostly water so this is also good for those with sensitive skin. Because Eau fraiches are mixed with mostly water and serve as a quick refresher without a long-lasting scent.
                        On a final note, along with fragrance types it is important to know that there are also fragrance notes which determine the final scent.

                                    Eau Fraiche since mixed mostly with water has the most mild scent and less longitivity hence it's a great option for causal outfit which won't last for a long time.
